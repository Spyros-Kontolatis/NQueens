# NQueensMobile
The classic problem of N queens, originally published by Max Bezzel in 1848, is defined like this:
Place N queens in a NxN chessboard so that no queen threatens any other.<br/>
A queen threatens another chess piece if they share the same row, column or diagonal.<br/>
This game is a slight alteration of the N-queens problem:<br/>
In a NxN chessboard we need to place M queens ( M less than or equal to N)<br/>
so that no queen threatens another and additionally,all chessboard tiles are threatened by at least one queen.
